SMART ENERGY MONITOR - ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-30 days):
1. HIGH PRIORITY - Address top energy consumers:
   • Bedroom AC: Consider usage scheduling (saves ~$14.05/month)
   • Electric Dryer: Consider usage scheduling (saves ~$3.33/month)
   • Kitchen Fridge: Consider usage scheduling (saves ~$2.01/month)

2. MEDIUM PRIORITY - Implement smart scheduling:
   • Use timers for high-consumption devices
   • Shift usage to off-peak hours (6 AM - 4 PM)
   • Potential savings: 15-25% on energy costs

3. LOW PRIORITY - Monitor standby consumption:
   • Identify devices with high standby power
   • Use smart plugs for complete shutoff
   • Estimated savings: $5-15/month

SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (1-6 months):
1. Upgrade inefficient devices (ROI: 12-24 months)
2. Install smart thermostats and controls
3. Implement automated load balancing
4. Add renewable energy sources (solar panels)

LONG-TERM STRATEGY (6+ months):
1. Whole-home energy audit
2. Smart grid integration
3. Battery storage system
4. Energy-efficient appliance replacement program

MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue 24/7 monitoring for pattern recognition
2. Set up automated alerts for unusual consumption
3. Monthly energy efficiency reviews
4. Seasonal adjustment protocols

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- 20-30% reduction in energy costs
- Improved device lifespan
- Enhanced environmental sustainability
- Better energy usage awareness
