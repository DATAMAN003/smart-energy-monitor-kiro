# AI Analysis Module - Kiro Specification

## Purpose
Create an intelligent energy analysis system that provides actionable insights and recommendations without requiring external AI services.

## Core AI Features

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- **Usage Patterns**: Identify daily, weekly, and seasonal energy consumption patterns
- **Peak Detection**: Find high-consumption periods and devices
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spot unusual energy usage that may indicate problems
- **Trend Analysis**: Track energy consumption trends over time

### 2. Device Intelligence
- **Device Profiling**: Create energy profiles for each monitored device
- **Efficiency Scoring**: Rate devices on energy efficiency (1-10 scale)
- **Usage Categorization**: Classify devices by usage patterns (always-on, intermittent, peak-only)
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor device performance over time

### 3. Smart Insights Generation
- **Natural Language Reports**: Generate human-readable analysis reports
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide specific steps to reduce energy usage
- **Cost Impact Analysis**: Calculate potential savings from recommendations
- **Priority Ranking**: Rank recommendations by impact and feasibility

### 4. Predictive Analytics
- **Usage Forecasting**: Predict future energy consumption based on patterns
- **Cost Projections**: Estimate monthly and yearly energy costs
- **Peak Usage Prediction**: Forecast high-consumption periods
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Predict savings from recommended changes

## Implementation Strategy

### Mock AI System
Since gpt-oss is not yet available, implement an intelligent mock AI that:
- Uses statistical analysis and pattern recognition
- Provides realistic insights based on actual data patterns
- Generates human-like recommendations
- Maintains the same interface for future gpt-oss integration

### Data Analysis Methods
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, median, standard deviation of power usage
- **Time Series Analysis**: Trend detection and seasonal patterns
- **Correlation Analysis**: Find relationships between devices and usage
- **Threshold Analysis**: Identify devices exceeding normal usage patterns

### Insight Categories
1. **Efficiency Insights**: Device-specific efficiency recommendations
2. **Usage Pattern Insights**: Time-based usage optimization
3. **Cost Optimization Insights**: Money-saving recommendations
4. **Maintenance Insights**: Device health and maintenance alerts
5. **Environmental Insights**: Carbon footprint and sustainability tips

## Output Format
- **JSON API**: Structured data for web interface
- **Human-Readable**: Natural language summaries
- **Visual Data**: Charts and graphs for dashboard
- **Action Items**: Prioritized list of recommendations

## Future gpt-oss Integration
- **Seamless Transition**: Same interface, enhanced capabilities
- **Enhanced Analysis**: More sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Better Recommendations**: More personalized and accurate suggestions
- **Natural Language**: Improved human-readable reports
